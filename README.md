# Marcia Dantas Escreve
This website consists of two pages: one is the main page entitled **index.html**, where is provided a bio of the author, the medias she's in and some important links at the end. The first link leads to the second page, named **historias.html**, where I show the books released by her, with its titles, sinopsys, book cover, booktrailer and soundtrack. The second link leads to her newsletter, for those who wish to subscribe. The last link leads to Amazon, but it's a link created by her in order to gain comissions whenever someone buys something using this link. Everything is written in Portuguese because the author is brazillian. Most of the code is written in English, but there are some parts in Portuguese as well in respect to the names of the author's books.
